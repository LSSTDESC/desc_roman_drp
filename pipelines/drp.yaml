      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.

      These may or may not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data
      ID expression. This specific pipeline contains no tasks that require
      full visits. Running with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select
      partial visits that overlap that region.

      In data release processing, operators should stop to address unexpected
      failures before continuing on to step2.
  step2:
    subset:
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - updateVisitSummary
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.

      This is a mix of visit-level, tract-level, and collection-level tasks
      that must be run with a skymap data query constraint only (an instrument
      constraint is fine, but generally unneccessary).  For example, running
      with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select partial visits that
      overlap that region.  A skymap constraint is necessary to prevent
      isolatedStarAssociation from producing results for all skymaps in the
      data repository.

      Visit-level tasks include consolidateSourceTable,
      consolidateVisitSummary,
      finalizeCharacterization, updateVisitSummary.
      Tract-level tasks include: isolatedStarAssociation
      Full collection-level tasks include: makeCcdVisitTable, makeVisitTable

  step3:
    subset:
      - makeWarp
      - selectDeepCoaddVisits
      - assembleCoadd
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure
      - mergeMeasurements
      - forcedPhotCoadd
      - transformObjectTable
      - writeObjectTable
      - consolidateObjectTable
      - healSparsePropertyMaps
      - selectGoodSeeingVisits
      - templateGen
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.

      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints
      essentially all the time, because otherwise quanta will be
      created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.

      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally"
      fail when running this subset, but this isn't a problem right
      now because there are no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks
      regularly fail or we add tasks downstream of forcedPhotCcd,
      these subsets or the tasks will need additional changes.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
  step4:
    subset:
      - forcedPhotCcd
      - forcedPhotDiffim
      - getTemplate
      - subtractImages
      - detectAndMeasureDiaSources
      - transformDiaSourceCat
      - writeForcedSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2' and
      'step3' subsets

      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs or diffIm
      templates that cover these detector-level quanta are desired.
  step5:
    subset:
      - drpAssociation
      - drpDiaCalculation
      - forcedPhotCcdOnDiaObjects
      - forcedPhotDiffOnDiaObjects
      - transformForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateAssocDiaSourceTable
      - consolidateFullDiaObjectTable
      - writeForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - transformForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets

      This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks. These should be run
      with explicit 'tract' constraints in the data query, otherwise quanta
      will be created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.
      'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
      patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.
